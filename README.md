In this repository you will find my personal collection of projects developed using SQL language to query and manipulate data, and Power BI as a visualization tool.

# SQL-Projects

1 - [Members of Parliament - Expenses](https://github.com/GleiAzevedo/Members-of-Parliament)

This project aims to analyse the annual budget, costs and claims made by each member of parliament in the period 2022 - 2023. The dataset used in this project is avalaible on the IPSA website. IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is the independent body that regulates and administers the business costs and decides the pay and pensions of the elected MPs and their staff in the UK.

2 - [UK House Price]()

The house market in UK is the object of interest of this project, where index price, average price and First time buyer and former owner occupier, were the attributes dissected. Although the dataset provided by the government website dates back to 1968, the period chosen for this analysis is 2013 to 2023.

3 - UK Car Market

Car model entry price, the best-selling model and most popular colour in the used car market are just some of the several questions answered on this project. The data sourse is the publicly available DVM-CAR 2.0, a large-scale automotive dataset for visual marketing research and applications.
