1 - [Members of Parliament - Expenses](https://github.com/GleiAzevedo/Members-of-Parliament)

This project aims to analyse the annual budget, costs and claims made by each member of parliament in the period 2022 - 2023. The dataset used in this project is avalaible on the IPSA website. IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is the independent body that regulates and administers the business costs and decides the pay and pensions of the elected MPs and their staff in the UK.

2 - [House Price UK - 2013-2023](https://github.com/GleiAzevedo/House-Price-UK-2013-2023/tree/main)

Is the price of the house really increasing? If yes, for how much? Is this true for all regions? The focus of this analysis is the UK house price series from 2013 to 2023, where we can answer these and other questions.
